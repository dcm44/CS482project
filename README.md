# PROPOSAL
The problem we will be investigating is how cryptocurrency transaction speeds differ based on the integrity of the networks in which they are built on. This is interesting because cryptocurrency is becoming more commonly used in modern commerce, and may even change the financial system as we know it. 
To truly understand how a decentralized economy operates, we will dive into the documentation that was written by the network engineers whom built and enhanced them over time. As most of these networks have derived from the SHA-256 hashing algorithm originally used for creating Bitcoin, we will look into how newer network protocols play a role in overall transaction speed. 
The public data we will use to understand each network includes market cap of a cryptocurrency, market volume, amount of validators on the network (miners, stakers, or any entity ensuring transactions are valid), and the hashing algorithm itself used to validate the network transactions. It is said that certain algorithms are much faster based on the network validation process, so we will focus on how certain protocols operate and how speed is affected. 
A single algorithm can not be proposed, but we will begin to understand how netowrk layers can be leveraged for faster transaction speeds. 
We will dissect real-life transactions for each network and compare the network speeds based on our research. We expect the fastest transaction speeds to be conducted on the layer 2 Ethereum network, which we will try to prove with a linear regression model.
